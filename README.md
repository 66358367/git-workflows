## Introduction
Git workflows define the processes and conventions your team follows when using Git for version control. A well-defined workflow helps maintain code quality, collaboration, and project organization. This document outlines common Git workflows and best practices for effective version control in our project.

## Branching Strategy
A branching strategy is the foundation of any Git workflow. It defines how branches are created, named, and merged. Our project follows the [choose one: centralized/decentralized] branching strategy. This strategy includes the following main branches:

- **Main**: The main branch, also known as `master` or `mainline`, represents the production-ready code.
- **Develop**: The develop branch serves as the integration branch for ongoing work.
- [Other Branches]: Describe any other important branches specific to your project.

## Workflow Types
There are several Git workflows commonly used in software development. Choose the one that best fits your project's needs or create a custom workflow.

### Feature Branch Workflow
The feature branch workflow is simple and well-suited for smaller teams or projects. It involves creating a new branch for each feature or bug fix.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
2. Develop and test the feature in the branch.
3. Merge the feature branch into the `develop` branch when complete.

### Gitflow Workflow
The Gitflow workflow is a more complex strategy suitable for larger teams and projects. It defines specific branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.

**Branches in Gitflow:**
- **Feature Branches**: For developing new features.
- **Release Branches**: For preparing releases.
- **Hotfix Branches**: For addressing critical issues in production.

### GitHub Flow
The GitHub Flow is a lightweight workflow designed for teams using GitHub. It simplifies collaboration by focusing on pull requests.

**Steps in GitHub Flow:**
1. Create a feature branch.
2. Commit changes and open a pull request.
3. Discuss and review the pull request.
4. Merge the pull request into the `main` branch.

## Best Practices
- Commit regularly with meaningful messages.
- Keep branches small and focused on specific tasks.
- Always pull the latest changes from the `develop` branch before starting new work.
- Use pull requests or merge requests for code review.
- Write clear documentation and update it as needed.
